# The-Chosen-One
This is my mental algorithm, of how I will become a hacker without vulnerabilities.

Simple. 

1) I cannot have vulnerabilities in my personal life. A basic example: I will never have children. 

2) I cannot have sentimentality for family members, relatives, etc.
3) I will use Linux, as long as it is the system with the best programmers auditing its security. 
4) Analyse everything that has tracker in the code. 


Here is an example of an idol of mine -> 

//Snowden was smart, he was. But even with asylum in Russia, a country that theoretically protects him from the Americans and their allies, he is still at risk...  And now more than ever, as he will be a father.   <-     

Here's a commit of this mental algorithm. 

//There is a loophole, in being a humanoid of the male species, the nature of the species seeks to breed and reproduce, so the fight will be internal. I must hack myself at every turn and create mitigations to these "zero-day exploits".

I will use Linux, as long as it is the system with the best programmers auditing its security.
